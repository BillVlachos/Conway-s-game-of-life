# Conway's game of life simulator
This project is a simulation of Conway's Game of life with lot's of features for the user so that he can experiment and test things on the Conway's game of life algorithm.

In order to run the file (Conway's_Game_of_life.py) it must be in the same folder with the following files:
finalbackround.png
start.wav
ghost-chase.ico

If you encounter any problems running the file (Conway's_Game_of_life.py) because it does not read the above files comment out the lines:
line 15, line 356, line 363, line 364

I have also included a report of this project
